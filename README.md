# Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## 📌 Objective
Implement **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification using the **Iris dataset**.

## 📂 Files
- `KNN_Classification_Task6.ipynb` → Google Colab notebook with full code.
- `README.md` → Project explanation.
- (Optional) `screenshots/` → Accuracy graph and confusion matrix.

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🚀 Steps Implemented
1. Loaded the Iris dataset.
2. Normalized features using `StandardScaler`.
3. Split dataset into train and test sets.
4. Trained **KNN classifier** with different K values.
5. Chose the best K based on accuracy.
6. Evaluated model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
7. Visualized results with plots.

## 📊 Results
- Best accuracy achieved with **K = X** (replace with your output).
- Confusion Matrix and classification report included in notebook.

## 📥 Dataset
- Used built-in **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.
